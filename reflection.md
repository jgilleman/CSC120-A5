- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
    Association makes my programs more orderly, and I like being able to trace where data is being pulled from. I like having all the parts of a larger thing separated, and then assembled. I assume it's especially useful when you have a proect that requires a lot of parts which may have complex relationships to each other.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Initially I was confused about how we could have so many different methods all called display, but working through this assignment reinforced the idea that classes, objects, and variables are all kind of like different sized boxes with their own data and reference to other boxes. It's now natural for me, when adding code to these programs, to be constantly thinking about what type of thing I'm implementing (class, object, variable), what it needs (parameters, types of data), and what part of the program fits those requirements (ie, where I should put it). 

    For resizing the banner, I used these sources to learn why I was getting a nullpointerexception and how to write code that doesn't return that error. I was looking for something sleeker than just a for loop, but the other methods I found required setting up complex libraries (like you can't just import the library of java.StringUtils.replace(), you need to set up a bunch of stuff first).
